## Hi there, I'm Jack. Welcome to my GitHub Profile! 👋

I am a senior at the University of Notre Dame interested in using data to make productive financial decisions. After graduation, I will be working at a fintech company focused on revolutionizing the alternative investment industry. Outside the world of data, I love to play music, play tennis, and personally review Oscar-winning movies.

- 🌱 I’m currently trying to sharpen my skills in: Python, SQL, and Financial Modeling (through Excel)
- 🤔 Other data interests: Sustainability through data and renewable energy investments
- 📫 How to reach me: jmarchal@nd.edu
- ⚡ Fun fact: I once played Freebird on Broadway in Nashville
