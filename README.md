## Hi there, I'm Jack. Welcome to my GitHub Profile! 👋

I am a senior at the University of Notre Dame interested in using data to make productive financial decisions. After graduation, I will be working at a fintech company focused on revolutionizing the alternative investment industry. Outside the world of data, I love to play music, play tennis, and personally review Oscar-winning movies.
